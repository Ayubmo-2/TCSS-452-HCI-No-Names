  ## Redesign focus
  ### Efficiency: 
  Adding a way to figure out what a specific button does without leaving the software(i.e hovering over a button that gives some info) allowing an easier experience for new users

  what is currently happening in the above image is the user hovering over the sim traffic tool which makes a text box that contains an explanation to what the tool does exactly. When the user then clicks on it it enables the position mode which allows the user to then move the explanation around or exit it depending on their needs. 
  
  ### Clarification:
  Design a help feature that explains error messages or system feedback making it easier on the user new and experienced whenever they make an error to get feedback in an efficient manner instead of waiting until later in their project to make the realization.

  In the above image the user made an error where they are missing the phase assignment which caused an error message box to pop up. They have the option to either exit the message by pressing ok or clicking see more which will pull up different options to chose from to resolve the error. They can either get a clear explanation to the missing phase assignment error, the location of where the error occured, or an explanation on how to resolve the issue.
