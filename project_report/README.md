  ## Redesign focus
  ### Efficiency: 
  Adding a way to figure out what a specific button does without leaving the software(i.e hovering over a button that gives some info) allowing an easier experience for new users

  what is currently happening in the above image is the user hovering over the sim traffic tool which makes a text box that contains an explanation to what the tool does exactly. When the user then clicks on it it enables the position mode which allows the user to then move the explanation around or exit it depending on their needs. 
  
  ### Clarification:
  Design a help feature that explains error messages or system feedback making it easier on the user new and experienced whenever they make an error to get feedback in an efficient manner instead of waiting until later in their project to make the realization.

  In the above image the user made an error where they are missing the phase assignment which caused an error message box to pop up. They have the option to either exit the message by pressing ok or clicking see more which will pull up different options to chose from to resolve the error. They can either get a clear explanation to the missing phase assignment error, the location of where the error occured, or an explanation on how to resolve the issue. 
  
## Design Process
### Testing
In our design process we went through different methods to get feedback for our prototypes this included both usability testing and heuristic testing and the other was user interviews. In our usability testing students from our class used our paper prototype as shown below and were then interviewed to gain an understanding of how a regular user would feel using that specific layout. We also went through heurestic testing where students from our class where asked to look at our digital protypes and provide any useful feedback to improve it based on their experiences. 
### Feedback
From these tests we received useful feedback and learned that users would immediatly click the see more when encountered with an error message and wanted the confusing close ("X") and OK button to be removed as it just provided redundency. They also asked about behavior in offline mode and error reporting options and appresiated instant access to button info. They made suggestions like tooltip behavior tweaks for offline mode and visual coherence. 
### Improvements 
With the feedback that was gained we were able to add context, quick fixes, forum references, and hover tooltipes with brief descriptions.

During the interviews the user asked the following questions "How can you report new errors" which moved us to add a bug report button.

They also asked the questions "could there be different colors to indicate different functions", "how does the error messages behave under different conditions like offline use and how does that affect forum references" because of this we decided to provide offline accesible documentation. 

During the testing portion we notcied that the user would get frustrated with not understanding the function of most of the buttons. We then decided to go back and add the feature that would allow the user to move the quick tip for each tool around the screen instead of having to hover over it so that they would be able to look at it while working on their project.
