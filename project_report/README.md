## Problem and Design Overview
### Problem:
Synchro Studio, a widely used traffic simulation tool, presents users‚Äîespecially first-time users and students‚Äîwith several key challenges: a cluttered interface, unclear navigation, and a lack of guidance. These usability issues result in inefficient workflows and steep learning curves.

### Our Design Solution:
Our redesign focuses on improving usability and discoverability without compromising core functionality. We addressed these issues by streamlining the visual layout, introducing contextual button tooltips, and enhancing error messaging with actionable feedback. These changes aim to support both novice learners in classroom settings and professionals managing complex traffic systems.

  ## Redesign focus
  ### Efficiency: 
  Adding a way to figure out what a specific button does without leaving the software(i.e hovering over a button that gives some info) allowing an easier experience for new users

  what is currently happening in the above image is the user hovering over the sim traffic tool which makes a text box that contains an explanation to what the tool does exactly. When the user then clicks on it it enables the position mode which allows the user to then move the explanation around or exit it depending on their needs. 
  
  ### Clarification:
  Design a help feature that explains error messages or system feedback making it easier on the user new and experienced whenever they make an error to get feedback in an efficient manner instead of waiting until later in their project to make the realization.

  In the above image the user made an error where they are missing the phase assignment which caused an error message box to pop up. They have the option to either exit the message by pressing ok or clicking see more which will pull up different options to chose from to resolve the error. They can either get a clear explanation to the missing phase assignment error, the location of where the error occured, or an explanation on how to resolve the issue. 

## Design Research and Key Insights
### Research Goals:
We wanted to understand how civil engineering students and professionals interact with Synchro Studio, pinpoint usability pain points, and explore opportunities for improving onboarding, workflow, and feature clarity.

### Methods & Participants:
Surveys sent to UWT Discord users, current TCE 327 students, and alumni
Interviews with a TCE course instructor and a project manager (Clara Dubow)
In-class observations of student usage during a Synchro Studio lab session

### Why These Methods:
Surveys allowed for broad insights into usability issues; interviews provided professional and academic perspectives; and observation helped capture real-time user struggles and navigation patterns.

### Key Insight #1: The learning curve is too steep.
Source: Observations and surveys.

Example: Students repeatedly got stuck on simple tasks, often entering data incorrectly or losing track of instructions.

Impact: We prioritized better onboarding tools and simplified workflows to reduce friction and confusion.

### Key Insight #2: Users don‚Äôt understand what buttons do.
Source: Observations and usability testing.

Example: Buttons lacked tooltips or descriptions, leaving users to guess or seek help elsewhere.

Impact: We implemented hover tooltips and color-coded hints to improve feature discoverability.

### Key Insight #3: Error messages were vague and unhelpful.
Source: Interviews, surveys, usability testing.

Example: Users encountering a ‚ÄúMissing Phase Assignment‚Äù error didn‚Äôt know how to resolve it.

Impact: We redesigned error messages to include explanations, quick fixes, and direct links to community forums.
  
## Design Process
### Testing
In our design process we went through different methods to get feedback for our prototypes this included both usability testing and heuristic testing and the other was user interviews. In our usability testing students from our class used our paper prototype as shown below and were then interviewed to gain an understanding of how a regular user would feel using that specific layout. We also went through heurestic testing where students from our class where asked to look at our digital protypes and provide any useful feedback to improve it based on their experiences. 
### Feedback
From these tests we received useful feedback and learned that users would immediatly click the see more when encountered with an error message and wanted the confusing close ("X") and OK button to be removed as it just provided redundency. They also asked about behavior in offline mode and error reporting options and appresiated instant access to button info. They made suggestions like tooltip behavior tweaks for offline mode and visual coherence.

### Improvements 
With the feedback that was gained we were able to add context, quick fixes, forum references, and hover tooltipes with brief descriptions.

During the interviews the user asked the following question "could there be different colors to indicate different functions" and were confused with the icons that were already displayed which allowed us to change the red circle that we had to an actual warning icon to get rid of any confusion that could occur.

They also asked the questions "how does the error messages behave under different conditions like offline use and how does that affect forum references" because of this we decided to provide offline accesible documentation. 

During the testing portion we notcied that the user would get frustrated with not understanding the function of most of the buttons. We then decided to go back and add the feature that would allow the user to move the quick tip for each tool around the screen instead of having to hover over it so that they would be able to look at it while working on their project.
