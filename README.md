Redesign focus 
  Efficiency - Adding a way to figure out what a specific button does without leaving the software(i.e hovering over a button that gives some info) allowing an easier experience for new users

  Clarification - Design a help feature that explains error messages or system feedback making it easier on the user new and experienced whenever they make an error to get feedback in an efficient manner instead of waiting until later in their project to make the realization.
